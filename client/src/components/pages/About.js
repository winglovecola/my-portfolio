      My name is Wing, and I bring over 20 years of experience as a dedicated web developer. My career has been marked by a strong proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, honed through a diverse range of projects and roles.
        <br/><br/>
        At W&T Website Design, I spearheaded numerous projects spanning e-commerce platforms, interactive forums, real-time chat applications, streaming services, and Flash game sites. This experience equipped me with comprehensive skills in web development.
        <br/><br/>
        Transitioning to TSquared Technology Solutions as a Full Stack Developer, I furthered my expertise by tackling complex challenges such as scripting for batch processing, integrating Google APIs, and fortifying data security measures. These roles enriched my ability to deliver robust solutions tailored to business needs.
        <br/><br/>
        In 2023, I pursued advanced training at the University of Toronto's Full Stack Developer boot camp, augmenting my proficiency with the latest programming languages and frameworks. This educational journey enabled me to execute several innovative projects, leveraging cutting-edge technologies.
        <br/><br/>
        In 2024, I contributed as a Full Stack Developer at a startup, where I played a pivotal role in crafting web and native applications using React, React Native, Node.js, and various AWS services including Amazon Cognito, DynamoDB, AppSync, Lambda, Serverless, and Amplify.
        <br/><br/>
        My skill set encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, Python, React, Ionic, Angular, jQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS Cloud, and integrations with Google API and OpenAI API.
        <br/><br/>
        I am eager to bring my extensive background and proactive approach to your esteemed organization, contributing to its ongoing success with innovative solutions and collaborative teamwork.
        <br/><br/>
