        My name is Wing, and I have been working as a full-time web developer for more than 15 years. Therefore, I have developed excellent programming skills for web development in both front-end and back-end.
        <br/><br/>
        Throughout most of my career, I worked with W&T Website Design, where I handled a wide variety of projects, including shopping sites, forums, chats, streaming sites, Flash game sites, and many others.
        <br/><br/>
        Later in my career path, I furthered my skills by working for TSquared Technology Solutions as a Full Stack Developer to develop complex applications. I handled tasks such as writing scripts for batch processing, utilizing Google API, and enhancing data security. I believe that the skills I learned in these positions would be a positive addition to your organization.

        In 2023, I decided to attend the University of Toronto to upgrade my programming skills by completing their Full Stack Developer boot camp program. During this program, I developed several projects using the latest programming languages and libraries.
